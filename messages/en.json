The app uses the public but limited free version of OpenAi API and Replicate API to generate: text, code, image, music and video. The app offers a free tier where the users are allowed to generate 5 different items. The users also have an option to upgrade to a pro version of the app which allows them to generate an unlimited amount of items ",

It was my first time using Next.js with the App Router which was still in beta at that moment. The App Router functionality changes a lot and I wanted to learn it and understand it as soon as possible "
