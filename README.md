## Description

I've created this app for myself as my portfolio website. I've used Next.Js with App Router, Zustand for client side state management and Tailwind. I also used some fancy libraries like next-themes, next-intl, resend, create-email, use-sound, useMediaQuery from usehooks-ts and Framer Motion.
The website is responsive and users have the ability to switch to dark mode, turn off sounds of the website and change the language of it. I tried to maintain good practices like creating reusable components and icons and carefully designing the file structure. The contact form has validation on each field. The website sends a confirmation email to the user and an email to the website owner with the content of the userâ€™s message The emails are built with html elements to look more professional than just plain text.

I plan to continually work on improving this website in the future/ I have a lot of ideas on how to improve this website in the future
